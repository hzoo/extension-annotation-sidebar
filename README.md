# henry.ink

what if every webpage had marginalia for notes? what if you could see what people are saying about what you're reading, right now?

## how it works

*web version*: visit `henry.ink/domain.com` and see that page alongside what people are saying about it. reader mode for cleaner text, archive mode to see the original styling. sometimes Arena channels appear as links when they match the content.

*extension*: shows discussions about your current page in the browser sidebar.

## Origins & Evolution

This project began as a [browser extension](extension/) developed for the [Community Archive](https://www.community-archive.org/) hackathon, focusing on finding discussions about webpages across social platforms. It's been evolving from showing Twitter discussions to Bluesky, Are.na, etc.
